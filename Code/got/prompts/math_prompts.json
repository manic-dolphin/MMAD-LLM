    "planner_prompt": "This is a complex mathematical proof problem from mathematical analysis. Utilize your mathematical and reasoning skills to provide an initial proof framework. Note that it might not be necessary to present the complete proof process; just outline the general proof framework. We'll gradually refine this proof process later on. However, ensure that the framework of the proof is in the correct direction and aligns with the original problem.",
    "generate_prompt": "Based on the original problem, enhance and correct the current proof using mathematical and reasoning skills to generate a new proof process. The current proof might have some issues like computational errors or incompleteness. Please note that the newly generated proof doesn't necessarily have to be a complete proof process, but it should advance upon the current proof. We will gradually complete the entire proof process later on. The original problem is {}. The current proof is: {}.",
    "refine_prompt": "Given the current proof, perform self-refine based on it to generate a new proof process. Please note that the new proof process shouldn't deviate significantly from the current one; only minor modifications are needed. The current proof process is {}.",
    "aggregate_prompt": "Given a set of proofs obtained currently, aggregate these proof processes. During the aggregation process, it's crucial to discern the differences between each proof and engage in thorough contemplation and reasoning based on the existing proofs. The final aggregated proof should retain the correct steps while discarding any erroneous ones. Note that the aggregated proof process shouldn't significantly deviate from the collective proofs, and its overall structure should align closely. Additionally, the length of the aggregated proof should be relatively similar to the average length of the proofs being aggregated. The current set of obtained proofs is {}.",
    "score_prompt": "Input: Instruction: Considering the initial solution along with the original problem, score the current solution on a scale of 0 to 10. #You must ensure that your output adheres to the given examples' format, here are examples: {}. #The initial problem is {}. Here is the current solution: {}.",
